# 📈 StockVision - Stock Price Prediction
The Stock Price Prediction project involves using machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices based on historical financial data such as open, close, high, low prices, and trading volume. The project treats stock prices as time series data and applies algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, Random Forest, or other regression models to identify patterns and trends. Key steps include data collection from sources like Yahoo Finance, data preprocessing to clean and structure the dataset, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). The goal is to predict short-term stock price movements to aid investment decisions, although challenges remain due to market volatility influenced by many unpredictable factors.

## 📌 Overview
StockVision predicts future stock prices using historical stock market data.  
The model uses machine learning algorithms to analyze past trends and forecast future values.

## 🗂 Project Structure
- `stock_price_prediction.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `stock_price_prediction.py` — Python script version of the workflow.
- `data/stocks_dataset.csv` — Dataset used for training/testing.
- `models/stock_model.pkl` — Saved trained model.
- `images/` — Plots showing predicted vs actual prices.
